# GEEQ Meet React Native app

## Project Description

This is a react native application called GEEQ Meet that was completed for the final project phase of Northcoder’s developer bootcamp.
The app is a social meet-up coordinator that allows users to create profiles and join group networks. Within groups, members can chat and arrange a meeting. The meeting functionality employs google places, directions and mapping services to find an approximately equidistant location between group members based on phone location data.
We used react native for cross platform support, Firebase for the back end and listeners for real time updates.

![Three phone screens. The first displays an image of strawberries, a search bar, a list of invited friends, and a list of current friends. The second displays a login screen. The last displays a chat screen.](https://github.com/TermMC/GEEQ/blob/main/assets/readMeImg.png?raw=true)

## Future implementation wishlist:

- Real time updating of user location
- Random place option
- Fully implement transport type
- Explore possibility of meeting point weighting based on user transport type
- Eventual completion and upload to the App Store
- Fix google map/Android bugs.

## Running the project

The project was written in JS React Native. To use, download, install npm dependencies and start the app with ‘expo start’. This may require an older version of node as some of the dependencies for the project are not compatible with versions > 16.0.0. (For node version management see the n package)

Expo provides a QR which can be scanned to run the app on a smartphone, to run a local copy an emulator will be required (e.g. Android Studio/XCode)
